# Homework 1 : Whyte Blood Cells Classification

In this assignment, you will classify 96x96 RGB images of blood cells. 
These images are categorized into eight classes, each representing a particular cell state. 
This is a multi-class classification problem, so your goal is to assign the correct class label to each RGB image.

We trained an CNN network with EfficientNetV2Small backbone and some regularization layers after.
Applying augmentation to the images and doing fine tuning to the model we achieved 0.90 score accuracy in the development phase of the challenge and ... in the final phase.
